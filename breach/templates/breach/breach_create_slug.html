subsequent forms.

overview of your breach reports. Select "Edit" there to continue editing

Please make sure to read the hints specific to each page of forms. These
are inside collapsible boxes (such as the one below), that can be
"folded in" in order to save screen space. You can choose below, whether
these boxes shall be shown (folded out) or hidden (folded in) by
default.

Assign a short name (a so-called "slug") to your breach report. The
short name is used for organisational purposes within this system and
does not matter otherwise. A reasonable choice would be some sort of
abbreviation of the processing activity that is related to the data
breach you are about to report. It should be 8-20 characters in length
and as unique as possible. Use all-lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens
and underscores, no umlauts or "ÃŸ". Enter, then submit. The system will
enforce unique slugs for breach reports - if you enter a slug that is
already taken, it will demand a different one.
