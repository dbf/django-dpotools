Which persons and groups take part in the processing and therefore have
access to the personal data processed?  This is not about personal data
you may intend to transfer as described in the "Recipients" and
"Transfer to third country" forms, but  refers to the actual data set
you intend to process. The members of your group and you are an obvious
example for an access group. If you intend to grant access to other
persons or groups at {{ controller }}, list these as well. A typical
example for external access groups are data processors or contractors
who do remote maintenance on your systems. Also, state the access rights
that each group is granted.  Please make sure to cover all categories of
personal data.

Please note: The choices you make for categories of personal data here
will not be saved, but evaluated and listed by number in the document
view of this RPA.  If you make changes to this form set later on, you
will need to make all choices for categories of personal data again.
