If you haven't already done so, please make sure to read the hints ("RPA
Hints", left menue) before you proceed. In addition to general
information, the hints explain the terms used below and in subsequent
forms.  Upon submission of this form, you will be redirected to the list
overview of your RPAs. Select "Edit" there to continue editing you newly
created RPA.

Please also make sure to read the hints specific to each form. These are
inside "folding" boxes (such as the one below), that can be "folded in"
in order to save screen space. You can choose below, whether these boxes
shall be shown (folded out) or hidden (folded in) by default.

Assign a short name (a so-called "slug") to your RPA. The short name is
used for organisational purposes within this system. It should be 8-20
characters in length and as unique as possible. A combination of an
acronym of your research project, administrative activity or other
intent and a year is usually a good choice (example: "satva2022"; you
will have the opportunity to enter a longer, more descriptive, "real"
name later on). Use all-lowercase letters and numbers, no umlauts or
"ÃŸ". Enter, then submit. The system will enforce unique slugs - if you
enter a slug that is already taken, it will demand a different one.
