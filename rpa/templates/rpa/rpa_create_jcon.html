A joint controller is a person or entity outside {{ controller }}, who
decides together with you on means and purposes of the processing of the
personal data in question (this is different from a data processor!).
Typical examples include joint research projects and regulatory
cooperation. There should be a contract regarding joint controllership
(add to annex).  If your processing activity does not include a joint
controller, set the according option to "No" and leave the other fields
untouched.  If your processing activity does include a joint controller,
set the according option to "Yes" and enter the contact data in the
respective fields.  The "contact person" field allows you to enter a
contact person as well as additional information you consider important.
