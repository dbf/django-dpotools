Personal data must be erased or anonymised as soon as the intended
purpose is achieved, except there is a legal requirement to keep the
data for a certain time span. Please fill in the time limits for erasure
of the personal data processed in the context of this RPA.  "Start" may
be an actual date or some kind of event that marks the beginning of the
processing activity. "Length" can be an actual time span (e.g. "3
months") or some kind of event that marks the end of the processing as a
whole or for the "lifetime" of particular instances of the data (such as
"6 months after termination of the contract").
Use the comment field to state legal requirements that apply for your
processing if necessary. Please make sure to cover all categories of
personal data.

You can use up to 5 forms to provide information about the time limits
for erasure for your processing activity. If that is not enough, choose
"A data erasure concept exists and is attached to the annex" as the very
first option, create a data erasure concept, if you haven't already done
so, refer to it in the annex and attach it to the final version of your
RPA. A minimal data erasure concept should resemble a list of
information as in each of the forms below.

Please note: The choices you make for categories of personal data here
will be both saved and listed by number in the document view of this
RPA. If you make changes in the categories of personal data form later
on, you may need to review the choices for categories of personal data
in this form.
